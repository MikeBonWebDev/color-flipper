Hi! This is a very simple web app allow you to change color in two mode:

1 Array Mode: There is a 5, 6 colors's array and you can iterating in pressing "Change Color". You can press the button until you're tired or the mouse is charge loss, as you wish...

2 - Advanced Mode: This is a second, most elaborate mode. In the half top square, you can choose between "hex, rgb, and rgba" from "select". Clicking on "Change Color Randomly", the color be show on the background and, based on your choose, it will be write on the top, on the right of "Color: "
However in half-bottom square, you can write your own color in a different way like: rgb, rgba, hex, linear, radial... Then, clicking on "Apply" and the color will appear on the background.


N.B. This app is not fully responsive, cause in this period I'm focused on JavaScript, also if I'll integrate most knowledge about in future.
